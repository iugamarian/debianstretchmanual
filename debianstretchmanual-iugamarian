#### Write, manage and understand C programs if you want to

# http://sillybytes.net/2016/06/how-to-write-c-in-2016.html

# Example 1 executable file is 71 bytes, use printf:
===================================================================================================
#include <stdio.h>

int main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
===================================================================================================
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program

# Example 2 executable file is 105 bytes, avoid using printf:
===================================================================================================

#include <stdio.h>

int main( )
{
        char *p = "hello, world\n";
        while (*p)
        {
                putchar(*p);
                p++;
        }
}
===================================================================================================
# *p is a pointer - a memory address where [hello, world\n] is written

#### Run Windows programs

# Taken from here
# https://wiki.debian.org/Wine

dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt update
apt install -y wine-development wine32-development wine64-development libwine-development libwine-development:i386 fonts-wine
# Quake 4 Demo works very well on amdgpu AMD RX480, no WIN32 prefix required,
# no extra dll's or configurations required except winecfg -> select Windows 7


#### Connect to wifi using only terminal

# Taken from here:
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/833905/how-can-i-connect-to-a-specific-bssid

# Show wireless networks with quality bars:
nmcli -f in-use,ssid,bssid,signal,bars  dev wifi
# Connect to one of the indicated bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX :
nmcli d wifi connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX password "mypassword"
# Security concern - password remains in .bash_history

# Or use nmtui for ncurses menu access to Network Manager

#### Debian Stretch Live with persistence

# See here included file debian-stretch-live-with-persistence for EFI and
# debian-stretch-live-with-persistence-for-old-laptop for no EFI, old BIOS.
# This manual explains persistence:
# http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/live-manual/stable/manual/html/live-manual.en.html


#### Boot on old laptop with BIOS

# If BIOS can't boot properly from USB, not fast or not found, use Plop Boot Manager from:
# https://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagers.html

# Write Plop Boot Manager to CD and boot from it with installed or live Debian on USB, select USB
# Very useful if BIOS does not have Boot from USB option.
# When boot is too slow, USB 1.1 instead of USB 2.0, it may be a hardware issue:
# Ground loop between GND of laptop and GND of external harddisk. Check by booting laptop on battery only.

---in vi or vim doing a right click and paste makes TAB's be incorrect so on OpenWRT over ssh
    you brick the router and need to connect to serial interface to unbrick - issue a "mtd erase rootfs_data"
    https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25421
    Solution: use "nano" or "cat ... EOF" to paste in terminal, through ssh
    
---"unrar" is non-free, so on Raspbian Stretch you only have the source from non-free, no binary
    Solution: install free "unar", it is intergated in graphical archivers, works as best as "unrar"
    Yes, without the r in it's name.

---when a full screen graphical application hangs, you can't do anything on the computer
    Solution: 1) press computer's the power button for a short time, then cancel, then kill application from System Monitor
              2) CTRL+ALT+F1 through CTRL+ALT+F6 login as root or as user, you can issue commands, best one would be reboot
                 You can return to the graphical desktop with ALT+F7 or CTRL+ALT+F7. When in text mode just ALT needed,
                 in grapgical mode CTRL+ALT is mandatory. If you know the name of the hanged application you can kill it
                 by doing textually "killall application", already available on Debian Stretch from the "psmisc" package

---Linux hangs when a (usually erronated) process asks for more memory than the computer has
    Solution: In a .conf file in /etc/sysctl.d write (swap more, 32MB only for kernel, less file data in RAM):
        vm.swappiness = 60
        vm.min_free_kbytes = 32768
        vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 300

---on a computer power outage you can lose unwritten data and there is a lot of it by default
    Solution: In a .conf file in /etc/sysctl.d write (max buffer 128 MB, write all that's older than 6 seconds):
        vm.dirty_bytes = 134217728
        vm.dirty_background_bytes = 134217728
        vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 600
        vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 600

---apt or web browser hangs on the internet for IPV6 addresses, this means the ISP does not allow them
    Solution: In a .conf file in /etc/sysctl.d write (disable ipv6):
        net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
        net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
 
 ---web browser does not refresh properly, keeps old page when F5 is pressed
    Solution: Press CTRL+F5 or with browser closed delete from home folder: .mozilla and .cache/mozilla
        To see hidden .files in most graphical file managers press CTRL+H and press again to deactivate.
